### <font color="#28ACE2">2.0.0</font>

Updated on Tue Mar 16, 2021.

### New Features

- Nested `metadata` props are now possible without limit. See [examples of nested props](/api-reference/objects#get-objects).
- No depth limit for Object relationships. The only limit is the prevention of infinite recursion.
- We now offer a [Postman collection](/api-reference/introduction#postman) to review and demo all REST API methods.
- You can now use the `after` param for Object pagination (experimental).
- We now have endpoints for `Metafields` and `Media Folders` to do CRUD operations directly.

### Improvements

- Lighter codebase, faster endpoints. In some cases, endpoint response times are up to 50% faster (non-cached).
- Better endpoint structures that follow standard REST conventions such as `POST /resources`, `GET /resources/:resource_id`, etc.
- Consistent error responses with verbose messages.
- The Select Dropdown Metafield now includes both `key` and `value` in the API response.

### Changes

- `_id` has been changed to `id`.
- `type_slug` has been changed to `type`.
- `status` can now either be `published` or `any` (which returns latest Object version draft or published).
- `query` is now the primary method for fetching and filtering Objects (Advanced Queries from v1). See [Queries and Logic](/api-reference/queries) for examples.
- Single Objects must now be fetched using `id`. To fetch by `slug`, you will need to use `query`.
- `write_key` will now be required in the request header as `Authorization Bearer`.
- `metafields` are hidden by default.
- Stricter user input requirements. No additional fields are possible in the body for `POST` and `PATCH` requests.
- There is a new, more secure token authentication strategy.
