# Getting Started

The best way to get started with the dashboard is to:

1. [Sign up for a Cosmic account](https://app.cosmicjs.com/signup)
2. Create a new Bucket: Start from scratch or install one of the [App Templates](https://www.cosmicjs.com/apps) (to see how content is modeled for a specific use case)
3. Follow the concepts below to understand the capabilities

## Concepts

### What is a Bucket?

A Bucket is the main piece in the Cosmic content structure. It's very flexible and can power the content for an entire website or a portion of a website. Since your Bucket content is delivered via an API endpoint, your Bucket can also power content for any application including iOS, Android, tvOS, Apple Watch, IOT, AR/VR or any other way that you would like to distribute your content. You may need multiple Buckets for different environments (for example one Bucket for Staging, one Bucket for Production, etc).

### What is an Object Type?

An Object Type is any collection of Objects that share a similar function. Pages, articles, projects, etc.

### What is an Object?

An Object can be a page, a blog post, or anything you want it to be. Cosmic gives you the freedom to create and manage content openly and create your own data structure. Each Object allows for the creation of a title, slug, content and Metafields.

### What are Metafields?

Metafields are very powerful pieces of custom data. Current available Metafield types include: text, textarea, HTML textarea, select dropown, image / file upload, date, single Object relationship, multiple Object relationship, radio buttons, check boxes, markdown, parent with nested children, repeater, and JSON. Your created Metafields are transformed into key/values stored as Metadata in the API endpoints.
