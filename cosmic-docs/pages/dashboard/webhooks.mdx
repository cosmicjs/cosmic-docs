# Webhooks

Cosmic makes it easy to add Webhooks to trigger a `POST` request to the endpoint of your choice when an event occurs in your Bucket. This is great for integrating static site rebuilds whenever content is changed, or adding third-party integrations like notifying your team on Slack whenever content has been added.

## Format

All requests to your endpoint are sent via `POST` with Header and Body information. For example:

#### Example Header

```json
{
  "content-length": "450", // Your content length
  "x-cosmicjs-event": "object.edited.draft", // Your event key (see below)
  "accept": "application/json",
  "content-type": "application/json"
}
```

#### Example Body

```json
{
  "type": "object.edited.draft",
  "created_at": 1576861549889,
  "data": {
    "_id": "5dfcff5d6340c9000865cc25",
    "slug": "my-awesome-title",
    "title": "My Awesome Title",
    "content": "<p>My awesome content</p>",
    "metafields": [],
    "modified_at": "2019-12-20T17:05:49.879Z",
    "modified_by": "56d66b2f903a79b904000001",
    "type_slug": "tests",
    "status": "draft",
    "publish_at": null,
    "bucket": "5df644188e47080008e7721a",
    "created_at": "2019-12-20T17:05:49.879Z",
    "created_by": "56d66b2f903a79b904000001",
    "metadata": null
  }
}
```
