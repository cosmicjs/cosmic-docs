# Developer Dashboard

If you want to contribute to our ecosystem of [Apps](https://www.cosmicjs.com/apps), [Extensions](https://www.cosmicjs.com/extensions), and [Articles](https://www.cosmicjs.com/articles) you can do so by following these steps:

1. Request access to the Developer Program in [Account Settings](https://app.cosmicjs.com/account/developer-program).
2. After approval, you can go into your [Developer Dasboard](https://app.cosmicjs.com/developers/apps) and submit your App, Extension, or Article for approval and publication.

We regularly showcase great work in our community which can lead to free stuff and more formal work with us.

Any questions? Reach out to us on our [Slack channel](https://www.cosmicjs.com/community).
