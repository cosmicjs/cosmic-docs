## Get started

Start by going to [https://www.cosmicjs.com](https://www.cosmicjs.com/), create your **free account** and set up a project. You can get started from scratch, or start with a [pre-built template](https://www.cosmicjs.com/apps). Then follow the steps below to use this NPM package.

## Install

Install the Cosmic NPM module:

```bash
pnpm install cosmicjs
# OR
yarn add cosmicjs
# OR
npm install cosmicjs
```

## Import

Import Cosmic into your app:

```js
const Cosmic = require("cosmicjs");
const api = Cosmic();
```

## Set environment variables

In your [Cosmic admin dashboard](https://app.cosmicjs.com/login) go to *Your Bucket > Settings > API Access* and get your Bucket slug and read key then set the variables in your app to connect to your Bucket:

```js
const bucket = api.bucket({
  slug: "YOUR_BUCKET_SLUG",
  read_key: "YOUR_BUCKET_READ_KEY",
});
```

## Get content

Delivering content to your app is simple by using the `getObjects` method.

**Get multiple Object**

Uses `getObjects` method within a `query` param. Additional options noted below.

```js
const params = {
  query: { type: "products" },
  props: "title,slug,metadata", // response properties
  limit: 10, // number of Objects returned
};
const data = await bucket.getObjects(params);
```

**Get single Object by slug**

Uses the `getObjects` method and query param.

```js
const params = {
  query: {
    type: "pages",
    slug: "home",
    locale: "en", // optional, if localization set on Objects
  },
  props: "title,slug,metadata",
};
const data = await bucket.getObjects(params);
const home = data[0]; // returns array
```
