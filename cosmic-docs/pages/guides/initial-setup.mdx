# Initial Setup

Before doing any coding, let's set up a Bucket with content using the following steps:

1. Create or log in to your [Cosmic account](https://app.cosmicjs.com)
2. Install the [Simple Blog](https://www.cosmicjs.com/apps/simple-blog) by clicking "Select App" then following the steps to create a new Bucket with the demo content. Alternatively, you could start by creating a new Bucket from scratch and add an Object Type titled `Posts` that has the slug `posts` and add a File Metafield titled `Hero` with key `hero`. Then add a few Objects with your own demo content.

Now that we have some demo content, we can integrate the content using the following development tools.
