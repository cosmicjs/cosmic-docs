# Advanced Queries

There will be times when you need to retrieve data from Cosmic in more complex ways than simply querying a record by its slug or ID. For example, you might have an app that collects user information for an online store.

There will be times you need to fetch a list of users that have ordered a specific item or you need to decide who your super-users are based on them not purchasing at a certain time of day. 

We'll walk through a few of these scenarios and the code you can run to execute similiar queries.

## Some Code Set Up

The accompanying ES6 examples will use the following import and Cosmic object setup:

```js
import Cosmic from 'cosmicjs'

const api = Cosmic()

const bucket = api.bucket({
  slug: process.env.BUCKET_SLUG,
  read_key: process.env.READ_KEY,
  write_key: process.env.WRITE_KEY,
})
```

### Get objects with the exact object type

You may need to retrieve all of the items you have available in your store and you can use the following code snippets to do so.

```js
bucket.getObjects({
    query: {
      type: "items",
    },
  })
```

### Get objects with the exact object title

There might be a certain product you need to look at and you have the title available from your front-end.

```js
bucket.getObjects({
    query: {
      title: "Mango Nation Hat",
    },
  })
```

### Get objects with the exact ID

You may need to get an object based on its ID that was hidden in a form.

```js
bucket.getObjects({
    query: {
      id: "item_id",
    },
  })
```
