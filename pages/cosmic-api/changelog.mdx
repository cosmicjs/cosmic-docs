# Changelog

### <font color="#28ACE2">2.0.0-alpha</font>

Published on Tue Jan 26 2021.

### Changes

- `_id` has been changed to `id`.
- `type_slug` has been changed to `type`.
- Single Objects are now returned using `id` only. To return by `slug`, you will need to use `query`.
- `write_key` will now be required in the request header as `Authorization Bearer`.
- `metafields` are hidden by default.
- The Select Dropdown Metafield API response now includes `key` and `value`.
- Objects are now only able to be searched and filtered using the `query` param (Advanced Queries in v1). See [Queries and Logic](/cosmic-api/queries) for examples.

### Improvements

- Better REST API endpoint structure `GET /resources/:resource_id`, `POST /resources`, etc.
- Better error handling with proper messages.
- Nested `metadata` props are now possible without limit. See [examples of nested props](/cosmic-api/objects#get-objects).
- No depth limit for Object relationships. The only limit is a prevention of infinite recursion.
- No additional fields are possible in the body (`POST`, `PATCH`).
- Endpoints have been added for `Metafields`.
- Endpoints have been added for `Media Folders`.
