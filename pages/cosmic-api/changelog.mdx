# Changelog

### <font color="#28ACE2">2.0.0-alpha</font>

Published on Tue Jan 26 2021.

### Changes

- `_id` has been changed to `id`.
- `type_slug` has been changed to `type`.
- Single Objects are now returned using `id` only. To return by `slug`, you will need to use `query`.
- `write_key` will now be required in the request header as `Authorization Bearer`.
- `metafields` are hidden by default.
- Select Dropdown Metafield metadata response from the API now includes `key` and `value`.
- Filtering of Objects is now only possible using `query`.

### Improvements

- Better REST API endpoint structure `GET /resources/:resource_id`, `POST /resources`, etc.
- Better error handling with proper messages.
- Nested `metadata` props are now possible. See [Get Objects examples](/cosmic-api/objects#get-objects) with nested props.
- No depth limit for Object relationships. The only limit is a prevention of infinite recursion.
- No additional fields are possible in the body (`POST`, `PATCH`).
- Endpoints for `Metafields`.
- Endpoints for `Media Folders`.
