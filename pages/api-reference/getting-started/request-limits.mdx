# Request Limits

### Rate Limits

All Cosmic Buckets have a rate limit of `500` API requests per second per IP address. This only applies to non-cached API requests. Non-cached API requests include any initial `GET` request, all `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests to the API. This does not apply to any files or images served via the Cosmic CDN or imgix CDN.

### Response Time Limits

Endpoints will timout at 10 seconds. If you find yourself hitting this limit, you may want to use `limit` and `props` to minimize your payload.

### Size Limits

Except for the upload media endpoint, which allows up to `900MB` files to be uploaded, all Cosmic requests and responses have a size limit of `6MB`.

### Optimizations

All requests allow `gzip` ecoding. If connecting to the API directly, adding `Accept-Encoding: gzip` can dramatically reduce response time and size. This is added by default on all Cosmic open source clients.
