# Cosmic Docs

Welcome to the new documentation site for the [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com) headless CMS.

In this site you will find documentation for the v2 release of the REST API (currently in alpha). For the stable v1 release of the REST API, go to [https://docs.cosmicjs.com](https://docs.cosmicjs.com).

Find references to READ, ADD, EDIT, and DELETE content from your Cosmic Buckets as well as perform select actions on your account. All requests require an account on Cosmic. [Sign up for a free account](https://app.cosmicjs.com/signup).

## About this site

This new docs site is build on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It includes dark mode üåí and the codebase is available open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/cosmicjs/cosmic-docs). It currently features direct API methods, but we'll soon be adding:

- Node.js methods
- GraphQL methods
- Search
- Guides

Contributions welcome!
