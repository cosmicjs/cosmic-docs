# Cosmic

<Features />

The Cosmic docs contains references to interact with the Cosmic API and available clients. Learn methods to `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` content from your Buckets. If you do not have a Cosmic account with a Bucket already set up, you will need to sign up and follow the steps to create a new Bucket. [Create free account ‚Üí](https://app.cosmicjs.com/signup)
