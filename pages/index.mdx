## About this site

This site uses the [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) static site generator which uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). It is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), includes dark mode üåí, and the codebase is available open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/cosmicjs/cosmic-docs). It currently features direct API methods, but we'll soon be adding:

- GraphQL methods
- Search
- Guides

Contributions welcome!
