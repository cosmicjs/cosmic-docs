<Features />

## Overview

üëã Welcome to the new documentation site for the [Cosmic headless CMS](https://www.cosmicjs.com).

In this site you will find information for the REST API v2 release (currently in alpha). See the [changelog](/api-reference/changelog) for a list of updates.

We plan on adding the other methods and clients (NPM, GraphQL, and CLI) to these docs soon, but if you need these now go to v1: [https://docs.cosmicjs.com](https://docs.cosmicjs.com).

In this site, find references to interact with the Cosmic API including methods to `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` content from your Buckets. If you do not have a Cosmic account with a Bucket already set up, you will need to sign up and follow the steps to create a new Bucket.

## About This Site

This is a temporary location for the new docs site to present the new REST API v2 and gather feedback. Though it currently only features the REST API methods, we'll soon be adding:

- [Node.js methods](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cosmicjs)
- [GraphQL methods](https://docs.cosmicjs.com/graphql-api/)
- [CLI methods](https://docs.cosmicjs.com/cli/)
- Search

### How it's built

This site uses the [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) static site generator which uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). It includes dark mode üåí, is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) ‚ñ≤, and the codebase is available open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/cosmicjs/cosmic-docs).
Contributions welcome!
