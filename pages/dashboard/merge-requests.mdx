# Merge Requests

<i>Merge Requests</i> is a feature in your Cosmic dashboard that enables Git-like
workflows for your content. With Merge Requests, you are now able to merge content
between Bucket environments with bulk edits, preview, and approval workflows.

## Getting Started

Get started by installing the <a href="https://www.cosmicjs.com/apps/next-merge" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Next Merge starter</a> or
read the step-by-step process for how it works below.

### 1. Edit Content

A content editor creates or edits content in a source Bucket.

### 2. Create Merge Request

The content editor then creates a merge request from the source Bucket into a target Bucket. Diffs are displayed in a list for review.

Team admins may be invited to review and approve the updates.

### 4. Approve and Merge Changes

The team admin can then use preview links to preview changes on the user-facing application or website. Once all approvals are submitted, the admin merges the request into the target Bucket.

### 5. Revert Changes

If there is a need to revert, a backup will automatically be made prior to the merge, and you will be able to restore to this backup instantly, and at anytime in the future. (Automatic backups will need to be enabled on the Production Bucket)
