## Getting started

Go to _Your Bucket > Settings > Extensions_. There are [pre-built Extensions available for install](https://cosmicjs.com/extensions) to extend the functionality of your Bucket. All of the code is open source. You can also build your own Extensions. They are simply [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) apps (static web app built using HTML / CSS / JavaScript).

### Adding an extension

1. Go to _Your Bucket > Extensions > Add Extension_
1. You can add either an Extension that points to a URL (https required, X-Frame Options enabled) or upload a zip file that contains a static web app.

## Extension via external URL

You can add an Extension by URL (https required, X-Frame Options enabled), title and icon.

### Query parameters

After adding your Extension, query parameters are attached to the URL for easy connection to your Bucket. The format looks like this:

```
https://my-custom-webapp.netlify.com?bucket_slug=your-bucket-slug&read_key=your-bucket-read-key&write_key=your-bucket-write-key
```

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bucket_slug          | Your Bucket slug. Use this to connect to your Cosmic Bucket for read / write / edits.                                                                      |
| read_key             | Your Bucket read key. Needed to read from your Bucket if this value is set in your Bucket > Settings > Basic.                                              |
| write_key            | Your Bucket write key. Needed for writes to your Bucket if this value is set in your Bucket > Settings > Basic.                                            |
| [custom key / value] | You can add unlimited custom query pamaters such as 3rd-party API keys to connect to different services. Find this in your Cosmic Extension settings page. |

## Extension via static web app

Check out the [Extension Starter](https://github.com/cosmicjs/extension-starter) to see a basic HTML / CSS / JavaScript example.

Add a static web app Extension to your Bucket by uploading a zipped folder that includes at least the following required files:

```
. (Your extension folder)
├── extension.json (Optional)
├── index.html
```

### Extension settings

The `extension.json` file sets information about your Extension. Add an optional [Font Awesome icon](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) to create a custom icon in the side nav. Add an image URL as the thumbnail image next to your Extension. Example:

```json
{
  "title": "Product Manager",
  "font_awesome_class": "fa-tags",
  "image_url": "https://this-is-your-thumbnail-url.xyz"
}
```

### Optional import data

Along with the Extension info, you can import data to the destination Bucket. By adding an `objects` array, you are able to import Objects. By adding an `object_types` array, you are able to import Object Types.

```json
{
  "title": "Product Manager",
  "font_awesome_class": "fa-tags",
  "image_url": "http://this-is-your-thumbnail-url.xyz"
  "objects": [
    {
      "title": "Product 1",
      "slug": "product-1",
      "type_slug": "products",
      "metafields": [
        {
          "title": "Image",
          "key": "image",
          "value": "1234asdf1234.jpg"
        },
        {
          "title": "Price",
          "key": "price",
          "value": "$12.99"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Product 2",
      "slug": "product-2",
      "type_slug": "products",
      "metafields": [
        {
          "title": "Image",
          "key": "image",
          "value": "4321asdf1234.jpg"
        },
        {
          "title": "Price",
          "key": "price",
          "value": "$14.99"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "object_types": [
    {
      "title": "Products",
      "slug": "products",
      "singular": "Product",
      "metafields":[
        {
          "title": "Image",
          "key": "image",
          "type": "file",
          "value": ""
        },
        {
          "title": "Price",
          "key": "price",
          "type": "text",
          "value":""
